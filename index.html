            <p>For my CS100 project, my team and I created a text-based decision adventure game. It contained branching paths leading to multiple 
                endings and featured a combat system where a dice is rolled based on the enemies and user's stats. Through this project I was able 
                to practice proper use of GTest and increase my experience with the following design patterns: Strategy, Abstract Factory, Singleton.

            <p>This 24 hour hackathon my team and I built a program that helps you with your work-break balance. The program takes the users anime 
                list as an XML file and after a set amount of time for work it'll bring up a set of anime streaming sites using the 
                JustWatch API for the user to watch one of the animes' in the list in their default browser during their break session. This is my First
                time using python and I mainly worked on the front-end of the development while offering insight for the back end of development.

            <summary><a href="https://github.com/Badminininja/Intro_AI" target = "blank_" rel="noreferrer noopener">A* Eight Puzzle Project</a></summary>
            <p>This AI project I did had me implement the A* algorithm with different heuristics  to observe the differences as well as the efficiency of the 
                heuristics  on the A* algorithm. This was my 2nd time using python, but it was what taught me the most about it and how to utilize it properly.

            <summary><a href="https://github.com/Badminininja/CS170" target = "blank_" rel="noreferrer noopener">Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor</a></summary>
            <p>This is my 2<sup>nd</sup> AI project that I did, and it had me implement machine learning through the use of forward selection and backwards elimination with a 
                nearest neighbor algorithm. The nearest neighbor algorithm was done through the use of leave-one-out cross validation to classify my data sets 
                for proper nearest neighbor associations.

            <summary><a href="https://github.com/Badminininja/CS166-Project" target = "blank_" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cafe Database Management System</a></summary>
            <p>This was my CS166 Database Management Systems project where I implemented a mock cafe where users can login and order from a menu. More privileged 
                users like employees or managers can change the menu as well as the orders made. I used Java and PostgreSQL to implement this.

            <p>This 12-hour hackathon was during my 1<sup>st</sup> quarter at UCR and was made to provide insight into an approximate carbon footprint
                that the user applies based on a questionnaire through calculations in the back end. We also dabbled in html to create a
                user interface.
