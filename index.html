            <p>For my CS100 project my team and I created a text-based decision adventure game. It contained branching paths leading to multiple 
                endings and featured a combat system where a dice is rolled based on the enemies and users stats. Through this project I was able 
                to practice proper use of GTest and increase my experience with the following design patterns: Strategy, Abstract Factory, Singleton.

            <p>This 24 hour hackathon my team and I built a program that helps you with your work-break balance. The program takes the users anime 
                list as an XML file and after a set amount of time for work it'll bring up a set of anime streaming sites is shown using the 
                JustWatch API for the user to watch in their default browser during their break session. This is my First time using python and 
                mainly worked on the front-end of the development. I offered insight as well as reviewing the back end of development

            <p>This 12 hour hackathon was during my 1<sup>st</sup> quarter at UCR and was made to provide insight on an appoximate carbon footprint
                that the user applies based on a questionaire through calculations in the back-end. We also dabbled in html in order to create a
                user interface.
