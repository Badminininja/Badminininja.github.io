            <div id="project0" class="project-summary">
                <p> I worked on a full-fledged online disassembler while at BitSecurerLab. I mainly bridged the technical communication gap between our abilities 
                    and expectations while also helping create a 3-d force-graph for the dissembler for ease of use. This was done using Vue for the framework. 
                    Now we are are trying to make the functionality of the 3-d force-graph to be a plugin for Ghidra to help with the dissembling process and 
                    add to visual clarity

                <p>For my CS100 project, my team and I created a text-based decision adventure game. It contained branching paths leading to multiple 
                    endings and featured a combat system where a dice is rolled based on the enemies and user's stats. Through this project I was able 
                    to practice proper use of GTest and increase my experience with the following design patterns: Strategy, Abstract Factory, Singleton.</p>

                <p>This 24 hour hackathon my team and I built a program that helps you with your work-break balance. The program takes the users anime 
                    list as an XML file and after a set amount of time for work it'll bring up a set of anime streaming sites using the 
                    JustWatch API for the user to watch one of the animes' in the list in their default browser during their break session. This is my First
                    time using python and I mainly worked on the front-end of the development while offering insight for the back end of development.

                <p>This AI project I did had me implement the A* algorithm with different heuristics  to observe the differences as well as the efficiency of the 
                    heuristics  on the A* algorithm. This was my 2nd time using python, but it was what taught me the most about it and how to utilize it properly.

                <p>This is my 2nd AI project that I did, and it had me implement machine learning through the use of forward selection and backwards elimination with a 
                    nearest neighbor algorithm. The nearest neighbor algorithm was done through the use of leave-one-out cross validation to classify my data sets 
                    for proper nearest neighbor associations.
